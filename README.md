# README
This project is a fulfillment of Project 1 Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity

## Requirements:
1. Basic full installation of Anaconda
2. Datasets from Stack Overflow Survey of 2019 (you can find it here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

## CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
### Business Understanding
This project is not involving any business. This merely to answer the trends of data scientist in 2019 based on StackOverflow Survey Result.
There are 5 question to be answer, which are:
1. What is their most preferred social media?
2. How old are they when started coding?
3. What is their education?
4. How much they work for a week?
5. How satisfy are they with their career and current job?

### Data Understanding
This data is a result from survei conducted by Stack Overflow in early 2020.

Survey result is the answer from the survey they conducted while schema is the question they asked to their users.

###  Prepare Data
Mainly the data is quite clean. However, there are some column need to be cleaned such as Age1stCode column. Since we don't use predictive model, so we will just clean the needed columns and rows.

###  Data Modelling
There are no data modelling since we don't do predictive model here.

###  Evaluate the Results
Here we will answer from the data analysis result:
1. What is their most preferred social media?
    Their most preferred social media is Reddit followed by Youtube then WhatsApp.
2. How old are they when started coding?
    They are mostly started coding from early to midteenager. However, there are some people who started coding in their early and late 20's.

4. How much they work for a week?
    Developers mostly have a good work life balance proved with 9-to-5 job (which means 40 hours a week).
5. How satisfy are they with their career and current job?
    Developers have very excellent career satisfaction with almost 60% says they are satisfied and very satisfied. Their current jobs satisfaction is also commendable.

###  Deploy
There is no model deployment since we are just doing data analysis.
